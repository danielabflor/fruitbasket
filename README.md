🍎 The Fruit Basket: Understanding AI Tokenization

An interactive educational game that teaches how AI breaks text into tokens using an intuitive fruit metaphor. Created for the AI, Robots, and Human-Machine Communication course at Boston University.

## 📖 About the Game

The Fruit Basket uses familiar objects (fruits) to make the abstract concept of AI tokenization tangible and engaging. Players learn by doing—selecting different fruits to match how AI would break down text into tokens.

### What You'll Learn
- ✅ How AI tokenization works at a fundamental level
- ✅ Why different languages require different numbers of tokens
- ✅ Real-world implications: cost disparities, performance inequality, and built-in biases
- ✅ Critical AI literacy: how technical choices create social consequences
